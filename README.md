## About TUM Analytics Cup 2022

In Analytics Cup 2022 challenge, teams developed a predictive model that classifies offers into successful and unsuccessful ones using multiple real-world data sets provided by Siemens Advanta Consulting and one of their clients. The given dataset contains offers for existing customers at facilities where Siemens' client company has already deployed some smart infrastructure products, but also offers to entirely new facilities without a previously existing business relationship. The products comprise the categories fire, security, and comfort. Our model lays the foundation for developing decision-support tools for the sales departments of Siemens' client.
